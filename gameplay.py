# Description:  The CPU of the game (imported into the main.py file)
#               It works whether the user wins/loses and 
#               determines consecutive guesses.
#   I hereby declare that I completed this work without any improper help
#   from a third party and without using any aids other than those cited.


"""
The random module allows for the generation of random numbers 
(face values of the dice).
Only one function - randint() - of this module is needed and 
therefore only one is imported to increase code efficiency.

The predefined dice module displays the face value of dice 
to the screen.

In general, the random module gives the face of each die 
a value which is displayed to the screen using the dice module.

        Become true when the user has guessed four or more

    -------
    ROUND : int
