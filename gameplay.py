# Description:  The CPU of the game (imported into the main.py file)
#               It works whether the user wins/loses and 
#               determines consecutive guesses.
#   I hereby declare that I completed this work without any improper help
#   from a third party and without using any aids other than those cited.


"""
The random module generates 'pseudo-random' numbers - face values on the dice.
The predefined dice module displays the face value of dice to the screen.
Generally, the random module gives the face of each die a value which is displayed to the screen using the dice module.
