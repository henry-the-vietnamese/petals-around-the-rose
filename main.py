# Description:  Build a mathematical challenging puzzle/game -
#               Petals Around The Rose.
#               This is the main interface of the game.
#   I hereby declare that I completed this work without any improper help
#   from a third party and without using any aids other than those cited.

The predefined gameplay module consists of the function start_game() which
calls another predefined module to display the face values of the dice to the screen,
work out the answer to the game, p[rompt for and evaluate user guesses, and
check for four consecutive guesses.

The module comprises two functions in total, but only one is imported as
the other one is not called in this file and thus
not imported to increase code efficiency.

Petals Around the Rose
----------------------
The name of the game is 'Petals Around the Rose'. The name of the
game is important. The computer will roll five dice and ask you to
guess the score for the roll. The score will always be zero or an
even number. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
work out how the computer calculates the score. If you succeed in
working out the secret and guess correctly four times in a row, you
become a Potentate of the Rose.
