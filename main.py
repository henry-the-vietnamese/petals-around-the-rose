# Description:  Build a mathematical challenging puzzle/game -
#               Petals Around The Rose.
#               This is the main interface of the game.
#   I hereby declare that I completed this work without any improper help
#   from a third party and without using any aids other than those cited.


"""
The predefined gameplay.py module consists of the function gamePlay() 
which calls another predefined module dice.py to display the face
values of the dice to the screen, work out the answer to the game,
prompt for and evaluate the user's guess, and lastly determine if
the user has four correct guesses in a row.

The module comprises two functions in total, but only one is imported 
as the other one is not called in this file and thus not imported to
increase code efficiency.

Petals Around the Rose
----------------------
The name of the game is 'Petals Around the Rose'. The name of the
game is important. The computer will roll dice and ask you to guess
the score for the roll. The score will always be zero or an even
number. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to work out
how the computer calculates the score. If you succeed in working
out the secret and guess correctly four times in a row, you become a
Potentate of the Rose.
