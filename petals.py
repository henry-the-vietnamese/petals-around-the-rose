Petals Around the Rose
----------------------
The name of the game is 'Petals Around the Rose'. The name of the
game is important. The computer will roll five dice and ask you to
guess the score for the roll. The score will always be zero or an
even number. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to
work out how the computer calculates the score. If you succeed in
working out the secret and guess correctly four times in a row, you
become a Potentate of the Rose.
