# Petals Around the Rose
**Aim**: Build a mathematically challenging puzzle in which the user is to work out the rule for determining the number of petals.

# Introduction
**Petals Around the Rose**
The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose and the name of the game is important. The computer will roll five dice and ask the user to guess the score for the roll. The score will always be an even number (including zero). The user’s mission is to work out how the computer calculates the score in order to become a Potentate of the Rose.

You are required to write a Python program that allows a user to play a game called Petals Around the Rose. The program allows the user to
repeatedly guess the answer to the puzzle until the user chooses to stop guessing/playing. Once the user chooses to stop guessing, the program
will report the user’s and game play statistics to the screen.

To see how this looks in practice, you may like to play a web version of the game:
